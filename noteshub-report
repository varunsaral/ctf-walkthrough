Hello , This is a security report of a assesment coducted on subdomain of 
http://noteshub.co.in , which is api.noteshub.co.in and i found several serious
vulnerbilites in the website, explaining each of them and how they can be fixed

1) API routes exposed too much sensitive information , while visiting 
http://api.noteshub.co.in , one can see the whole structure of API without any 
filtering which includes lumen logs , which ultimately leaks the underlying 
technology used in website with it's version (Lumen 5.5.2)

2)Outdated software , Lumen 5.5.2 is outdated and contain several vulnerbilites
one of them is info leak , if anyone make a GET request on 
http://api.noteshub.co.in/.env , it leaks the most sensitive part of webisite

Listing the leaked information here

APP_KEY=540a0a29f96e4d9262467450815ef24a087f96ca019a39cc689eb86xxxxxxxx

MASTER_ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=master@noteshub
MASTER_ADMIN_USER_AUTHKEY=p@ss4M@ster

DB_DATABASE=noteshub_prod
DB_USERNAME=noteshub_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=k4fMwcKMqW53pjdu

JWT_SECRET=592d2bef45b3eadc07c8c8d9963ada4547d6a9fc379f6090xxxxxxxxxxxxx

we all know they are the most important part of a website , moreover with
app key and a script https://github.com/kozmic/laravel-poc-CVE-2018-15133 , one 
can get a remote access to the machine on which noteshub is hosted and can result
in massive date leak.

With JWT too all private api can be accessed , with database user/pass the student
details can be leaked and with admin user/pass too

suggested fix:

Secure API with filtering :https://restfulapi.net/security-essentials/
Updated softwares:https://github.com/laravel/lumen

And one deep level pentest on website i have only scartched the surface.
(Attached screenshot with email)

At the end , I want to thank the whole community of noteshub to supporting the
student community
